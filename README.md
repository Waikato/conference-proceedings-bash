# conference-proceedings-bash
Bash scripts for managing conference proceedings written in LaTeX.

Original scripts used for [ACML 2016 proceedings](http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v63/) 
(published in JMLR).

## Files

* `articles.list`

  Defines the articles (and their order) for the proceedings.

  Format:
  ```
  name <TAB> dir <TAB> compiler <TAB> include in page count (yes|no)
  ```


* `build.sh`

   Builds all papers defined in `articles.list` (same directory as `build.sh`).
   The `articles.list` file contains the directories of the articles and
   the compiler to use for each article (eg `xelatex` or `pdflatex`).

* `list_page_no.sh`

  Once the `build.sh` script has compiled all articles, this script can be used
  to output the page numbers of all the articles. It also outputs the `start page`
  number for each of the articles. Articles, like prefaces, can be excluded
  from the start page count (see `articles.list` format).

* `update_start_page.sh`

  Updates the start page command sequences in the articles using the output
  generated by `list_page_no.sh`.
  
  The following LaTeX sequence gets updated:

  ```
  \newcommand{\startpage}{123}
  ```

## Example

Here is an example sequence of commands:

```
build.sh
list_page_no.sh > pages.txt
update_start_page.sh -p pages.txt
build.sh
```
